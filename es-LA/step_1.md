It's fun to keep track of a high score in a game.

Let's say you have a variable called `score`{:class="blockdata"}, which gets set to zero at the beginning of each game.

Add another variable called `high score`{:class="blockdata"}.

At the end of the game (or whenever you want to update the high score), you'll need to check whether you have a new `high score`.
